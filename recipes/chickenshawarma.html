    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your chicken into very thin strips.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken strips with the paprika, salt, 
            turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, hot sauce, olive oil, and vinegar. Stir 
            well to coat the chicken evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and 
            let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight for 
            best results.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated 
            chicken strips to the skillet and cook for about 7-10 minutes, stirring 
            occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and lightly browned. 
            While cooking the chicken, you may notice a significant amount of 
            liquid in the pan. Instead of draining it, it’s important to keep it in as it 
            contains a lot of flavor. Continue cooking the chicken until all the liquid 
            has evaporated, allowing the flavors to fully develop and intensify.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, slice the ciabatta rolls in half and spread a 
            generous layer mayonnaise on each half. Place the rolls on a separate 
            pan on medium heat until they are lightly toasted and the mayo has 
            turned golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of garlic sauce, place a few slices of pickles on one half of 
            the roll, followed by sliced tomatoes and raw onion.</li>
        <li>Add a generous amount of cooked chicken strips on top of the 
            vegetables, then sprinkle some mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Place the baking sheet with the sandwiches back under the broiler and 
            allow the cheese to melt and become bubbly, usually around 1-2 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>If using, add some caramelized onions on top of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place the top half of the 
            roll on the sandwich.</li>
        <li>And you're done !! If you end up having any left-over chicken, it is 
            perfect for meal prep throughout the week!</li>
