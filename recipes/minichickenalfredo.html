    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <h4>Alfredo sauce & Chicken:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt your 8 tbsp of butter down in a pan</li>
            <li>Sauté your minced garlic for 2-3 minutes or until fragrant (medium 
                heat). Be careful not to burn your garlic</li>
            <li>Pour in your heavy cream, mix, then throw in your freshly grated 
                parmesan.</li>
            <li>Mix on medium heat until your cheese is nice and melted. Then season 
                to taste with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Start with 1/4 tsp of each and adjust to your liking.</li>
            <li>After you Alfredo sauce is complete, cook your cubed chicken as well</li>
            <li>Set both to the side while you work on your dough</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Prepare your sponge:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together your yeast, sugar, warm water, and flour in a bowl. Cover 
                with a damp paper towel, and allow to sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Prepare your dough:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>After 10 minutes, add the rest of your flour (1 1/2 cups), salt, and olive 
                oil to your sponge.</li>
            <li>Take a large wooden spoon and roughly combine dough ingredients.</li>
            <li>Now, you can use a stand mixer – but if you don't have one, with lightly 
                floured hands, knead your dough for 8-10 minutes on a clean and 
                floured work surface until smooth.</li>
            <li>The dough will start off quite sticky, but after several minutes of 
                kneading the dough on an a floured work surface – it will eventually 
                come together beautifully. (Don’t add more than an extra 1/2 cup of 
                flour)</li>
            <li>Once your dough is smooth, cover and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Next, separate your dough into 8 dough balls (each around 70 grams in 
                weight). Cover with a damp towel and allow to rest for another 10-15 
                minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Shape your pizzas:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>After 10 minutes, lightly sprinkle flour on your work surface. Roll out 
                each dough ball about a half an inch thick.</li>
            <li>Once you've rolled out your dough – its time to build the crust.</li>
            <li>Add a light amount of freshly grated mozzarella to the edges of your 
                dough. Start folding your dough over the mozzarella, pressing down to 
                seal the edges. Watch video above for guidance.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°f (218°C)</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Baking your pizzas:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your stuffed, and shaped dough to a lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Brush egg wash on your crust, and spread your Alfredo sauce in the 
                center of your dough. (since we set our Alfredo sauce to the side while 
                making our dough, it should have cooled & thickened making it much 
                easier to spread)</li>
            <li>Add your chicken on top of your sauce, then add a layer of freshly 
                grated mozzarella.</li>
            <li>To finish them off add some fresh parsley, as well as some red pepper 
                flakes if you want a bit of heat.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes. Every oven preforms differently, keep a close 
                eye on them. You want the bottom of your pizzas, as well as your crust, 
                to be beautifully golden & not burnt</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and allow your pizzas to cool for a couple 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve fresh as an appetizer , or as your main course with a tossed salad 
                on the side!</li>
            <li>And you're done!</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>How to store them:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Store them in an airtight container. Store at room temperature for a 
                couple days, or in the refrigerator for about a week.</li>
        </ol>
