    <p> Today we’re making the fluffiest Garlic Naan! 
        If you have experience with baking bread, making 
        Naan should be a simple task for you. The end 
        result is a soft and fluffy bread with a slight 
        chewiness, infused with the rich flavors of garlic 
        and ghee. The garlic adds a pungent and slightly 
        spicy flavor to the bread, while the ghee imparts 
        a rich, buttery taste and helps to keep the naan 
        moist and tender.

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add in your yeast mixture. Cover with a damp 
                cloth and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, combine the rest of your ingredients in the large 
                mixing bowl. You can either use a stand mixer or knead the dough with 
                your hands. Knead until the dough comes together and forms a smooth 
                ball. About 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you're kneading the dough by hand; on a floured surface, knead the 
                dough for 10-15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. The dough 
                should not stick to your hands or the surface.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly floured bowl and cover it with a damp 
                cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size</li>
            <li>One helpful tip to ensure your naan dough rises properly is to preheat 
                your oven to 175°F, then turn it off. Once the oven is warm, cover your 
                dough and place it inside to rise. This warm, draft-free environment will 
                help to activate the yeast and allow the dough to rise to perfection</li>
            <li>After your dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough and 
                divide it into equal portions. Each one of my dough balls weighed 
                around 78-80 grams</li>
            <li>Cover your dough balls and allow them to rest for 15 minutes with a 
                damp cloth</li>
            <li>Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it into a disk on a lightly floured 
                surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into an oval shape, about 
                1/4 inch thick</li>
            <li>Now, pick it up gently and stretch out your rolled-out naan dough. 
                Gently pick it up and give it a slight stretch, making sure to rotate the 
                dough as you go to ensure it remains an even thickness. It's important 
                to note that naan dough should be quite elastic, so it should stretch 
                easily without tearing or breaking. (watch video for reference)</li>
            <li>After you've rolled out and stretched your dough let them rest for 10 
                minutes before adding to your hot cast iron</li>
            <li>Preheat a cast iron pan for 5 minutes on medium heat before adding 
                your dough to it. Do not add any oil to your pan</li>
            <li>Cook your naan for about 2 minutes on each side until it's golden 
                brown and slightly charred. Flip the naan using tongs or a spatula and 
                cook the other side.</li>
            <li>Remember to not overcrowd the skillet while cooking the naan. It’s 
                best to cook one naan at a time to ensure even cooking. Also, be 
                careful while flipping the naan to avoid burning yourself or tearing the 
                bread</li>
            <li>To maintain the warmth and freshness of your naan while you bake the 
                remaining bread, it's a good idea to wrap it in a clean towel or 
                aluminum foil, which will help to trap in heat and moisture, keeping the 
                naan soft and tender until it's ready to be served. In case you're making 
                a larger batch of naan, you can keep them warm by placing them in a 
                low-temperature oven at around 200°F until you're ready to enjoy 
                them.</li>
            <li>Remove the naan from the skillet and brush it with your Ghee mixture.</li>
            <li>And you're done :,)</li>
